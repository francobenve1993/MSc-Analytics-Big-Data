Assignment:

In this project you will be working with a real-world dataset from the Kaagle platform corresponding to the “AMS 2013-2014 Solar Energy Prediction Contest”.

The goal here is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the given dataset to extract information, carry on data cleaning and pre-processing, and/or visualize the dataset.
Some ideas of what can be done here are:

• Compute statistics of each column.
• Compute correlations.
• Outlier detection/removal/correction.
• Data scaling e.g. subtract mean and divide by standard deviation.
• Dimensionality reduction.
• Visualization of column values and distributions.
• Visualization of correlations.
• Visualization on a map using leaflet or similar.
• Anything that comes to your mind and makes sense. Creativity will be rewarded.
