In the fields of change management, culture development, performance management and so many more, insight offered by SNA is a powerful tool.
Social network analysis (SNA) can provide insight into social influences within teams, and identify cultural issues. The research conducted for SNA is interested in individuals, but the analysis itself focuses on connectivity: how individuals collaborate.
