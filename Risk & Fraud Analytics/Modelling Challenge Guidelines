MODELLING CHALLENGE GUIDELINES

The individual exercise is a Kaggle style competition.

- Please watch this video to see how to play the game: http://youtu.be/UpmUvJ5e_64?hd=1 
- Please sign up to http://manoelutad.pythonanywhere.com/ranking/6aQ6IxU7Va and choose Player profile 
- Then log in and visit the competition web page: http://manoelutad.pythonanywhere.com/ranking/6aQ6IxU7Va
- Watch this video with some ideas: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PU4N8EeQPc

EXERCISE GRADING: the grade will be divided into 3 parts

- 33% * the GINI score that appears in http://manoelutad.pythonanywhere.com/ranking/6aQ6IxU7Va Sunday 12th/December at 10pm (it will be devided by 
the best student * 10.0)
- 33% * the GINI score that appears in http://manoelutad.pythonanywhere.com/ranking/6aQ6IxU7Va x 17.0 (note this grade is from 0 to 10) for your 
user at the end of the competition. Your score in the page corresponds to the best score obtained during the whole competition.
- The other 34% of the grade will come from the grade (from 0 to 10) given by the teacher after the revising the Jupyter Notebook (code delivered 
by the student), and the Log Book (Word or PDF) with the description of the tests made by the student and what has worked and what has not worked.
 

What to deliver in here? Deliverables:  

The student must submit ONE zip file containing the python code (.py) or the Python Noteboook (ipynb) or R code (or, if you are using another tool, 
you should export the code/project) and the LogBook (template attached). The logbook must include the list of actions that you have implemented during 
the game and for each action/test you should state whether it has improved or not the model or show the KS/GINI achieved, and if you know the reason why 
it worked or not please include that (it is OK to try even if this is not the correct answer).
